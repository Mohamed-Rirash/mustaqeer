[Mustaqeer is derived from Arabic, meaning "one who is steadfast" or "one who is firm." This aligns well with the app's purpose of encouraging consistent Quran reading and tracking progress, as it promotes dedication and commitment to the practice. The name embodies the idea of perseverance in spiritual growth, making it a fitting choice for an application focused on Quranic engagement.]
