in here how about if i use aws lamda s3 and aws rds are they cost evective

Using AWS Lambda, S3, and RDS can be cost-effective depending on your usage patterns and specific requirements. Here's a breakdown of how these services compare to traditional hosting:

1. AWS Lambda
Cost Model: AWS Lambda charges based on the number of requests and the compute time used. You pay for the exact amount of compute power you use, making it cost-effective for applications with variable or low traffic.
Benefits:
Scalability: Automatically scales to handle traffic without the need to manage servers.
Cost Efficiency: Ideal for applications with intermittent or unpredictable traffic.
Considerations:
Cold Starts: There can be slight delays for cold starts, which may impact performance for certain use cases.
Complexity: Requires careful architecture planning to avoid excessive invocation costs.
2. AWS S3
Cost Model: AWS S3 charges based on the amount of data stored, data transfer, and requests made (GET, PUT, etc.). It’s generally very cost-effective for storing large amounts of data.
Benefits:
Scalability: S3 scales automatically with your storage needs.
Reliability: Highly durable and available storage solution.
Cost Efficiency: Low cost per GB for storage and bandwidth, with different pricing tiers depending on access patterns (e.g., S3 Standard, S3 Glacier).
Considerations:
Data Transfer Costs: There can be additional costs for data transfer out of AWS, so it’s important to account for bandwidth usage.
3. AWS RDS
Cost Model: AWS RDS is billed based on the instance type (compute power), storage, and data transfer. You can also opt for reserved instances to reduce costs.
Benefits:
Managed Service: Automated backups, scaling, and patching reduce operational overhead.
Scalability: You can scale vertically by choosing a more powerful instance or horizontally by adding read replicas.
Considerations:
Cost: RDS can be more expensive compared to managing your own database on EC2, but the trade-off is reduced management complexity and higher reliability.
Cost Comparison and Effectiveness
AWS Lambda + S3:

Cost-Effective for Variable Load: Ideal if your application has variable or low traffic, as you only pay for what you use.
Savings on Idle Time: Unlike EC2, Lambda does not incur costs when not in use, making it efficient for applications with intermittent traffic.
AWS RDS:

Cost-Effective with Reservations: If you commit to a longer-term usage, reserved instances can significantly reduce costs.
More Expensive for High Load: For high-traffic applications, the costs can add up, especially if you require large instances or multiple read replicas.
Overall Considerations
If you anticipate consistent, high traffic, using EC2 for the backend might be more predictable and cost-effective. However, for a new application where traffic is unpredictable, AWS Lambda can offer significant savings by only charging for actual usage.
S3 remains a cost-effective solution for media storage, and using it in conjunction with Lambda (for serverless architecture) can further optimize costs.
RDS, while potentially more expensive than self-hosted databases, offers the advantage of being fully managed, which can save time and reduce operational costs.
In conclusion, if your application has fluctuating traffic or you want to minimize upfront infrastructure costs, using AWS Lambda with S3 and RDS can be very cost-effective. For applications with steady, high traffic, EC2 might be a better option in the long term.
